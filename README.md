## Where is this published?

From this git repository we generate a PDF document.
Two in fact: the "draft" version which contains annotations and "todo's" and a version without those annotations.

For members of the EKGF there's a Slack channel called
[#ekg-principles-latest](https://ekgf.slack.com/archives/C01TZV0M36J)
where both PDFs are published every time someone pushes
a change into this repository.

> **Tip:** Soon we'll also be publishing this content as HTML.
