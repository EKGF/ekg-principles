<!--summary-start-->
_Data Points_ for any object may be stored in many physical stores.
Any access point provides connectivity to all EKG content regardless of where it resides.
<!--summary-end-->

The physical stores could include traditional databases as well as varied 
_EKG Platforms_ specifically designed for hosting EKGs. 
And some which may be hosted outside the enterprise including by information 
services or governments. 
All seamlessly accessed using W3C (internet-based) protocols which also allow 
for browser or API _linked data_ traversal and query.

## Rationale

Federating different systems allows the knowledge available to an enterprise 
to be accessed as a whole.
It allows best of breed systems to be used for specific purposes, 
and evolved over time without disrupting the EKG as a whole.
It allows scalability through adding new hardware, swapping out systems, 
and optimizing access through moving data closer to where it needs to be processed.

## Implications 

The potential for a loose and evolving nature does mean some degree of monitoring of 
access patterns and performance; and service level agreements for vital information access.
