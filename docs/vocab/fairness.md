# Fairness

Fairness is the ability of an organization or ecosystem to treat
participants equitably, recognize contributions appropriately, and
distribute information and value without undue bias.

In an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), fairness is not only a social
or HR topic. It also has a concrete meaning for data and knowledge:

- **Recognition of value-chain contributors**: make it clear who
  created, curated, and published data and knowledge, and what value
  they added.
- **Less biased appreciation**: reduce subjective or opaque judgement
  by using explicit criteria (e.g. quality, provenance, fitness for
  use, reuse) when selecting or ranking information.
- **Unbiased distribution of information**: make information available
  to the right people and systems, at the right time, based on
  entitlements and policy rather than favoritism.

Fairness is tightly linked to [transparency](transparency.md) and
[accountability](accountability.md): if you cannot see what happened,
or who did what, you cannot fairly evaluate outcomes or assign credit
and responsibility.

Fairness also aligns with the [FAIR principles](../fair/index.md)
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), which are widely used
in knowledge graph practice.
