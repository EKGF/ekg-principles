# Data Capital

Data Capital refers to the collective value of an enterprise's data,
information, and knowledge as strategic assets. It encompasses
structured and unstructured data, metadata, ontologies, models, and
knowledge representations that drive value creation, decision-making,
and competitive advantage.

To understand Data Capital in an EKG context, it helps to view the
whole enterprise ecosystem (internal and external) as a
[Data Economy](data-economy.md). Many people call this a
[Data Marketplace](data-marketplace.md), but a Data
Economy is a more ambitious view: a system of supply, demand,
exchange, and incentives.

In a Data Economy:

- **Supply side (publishers)**: Data publishers offer Data Products,
  often realized as [Self-describing Datasets (SDDs)](sdd.md).
- **Demand side (consumers)**: Data consumers demand data for their
  [Use Cases](use-case.md).

In the context of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKG), Data Capital
needs to be _known, valued, leveraged and optimized_. This means:

- **Known**: Publishers, Data Products, consumers, and Use Cases are
  discoverable, and their relationships are explicit.
- **Valued**: The value of data is assessed through
  fitness-for-purpose and reuse across use cases and organizational
  boundaries.
- **Leveraged**: Demand (use cases) is connected to supply (data
  products), enabling better insights, automation, and collaboration.
- **Optimized**: Quality, governance, interoperability, and incentives
  are improved to reduce friction and maximize value.

Data Capital complements [Human Capital](human-capital.md) as a
fundamental organizational asset. When connected through an EKG, the
combination enables better decisions, innovation, and competitiveness.
