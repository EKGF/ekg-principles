# Data Economy

A Data Economy is the whole ecosystem in which data is supplied,
demanded, exchanged, governed, and reused across an enterprise and its
external partners.

In a Data Economy there is:

- **Supply**: Data publishers offering Data Products, often realized
  as [Self-describing Datasets (SDDs)](sdd.md).
- **Demand**: Data consumers seeking data to realize their
  [Use Cases](use-case.md).

The role of an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) is to make this
economy explicit and operable: publishers, products, consumers, and
use cases become discoverable and linked, with meaning, policies, and
provenance available where and when they are needed.

Seeing the enterprise as a Data Economy helps to identify and grow
[Data Capital](data-capital.md): the value created when data is reused
across many use cases, teams, and organizational boundaries.
