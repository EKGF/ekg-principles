# Accountability

Accountability is the ability of an organization (or a person) to be
responsible and answerable for actions, decisions, and outcomes.

In practice, accountability requires:

- **Clarity**: who is accountable for what, and why.
- **Evidence**: facts and context that justify decisions.
- **Consequences**: commitments, obligations, and follow-up.

In an Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG), accountability becomes much
easier when it is modelled explicitly:

- **Assignments**: connect roles and people to activities, assets, and
  obligations (e.g. via a RASCI/RACI matrix).
- **Traceability**: connect outcomes and decisions back to the data,
  models, policies, and actors involved.
- **Auditability**: keep provenance, lineage, and governance artefacts
  queryable and explainable.

Accountability becomes concrete when responsibilities are tied to
explicit business intent:

- **Outcomes** define the "why" and success criteria.[^uctm-outcome]
- **Use Cases** define the scope and capability to deliver outcomes.
  [^uctm-use-case]
- **Personas** define who (people and systems) is involved and in what
  capacity.[^uctm-persona]
- **Stories** define requirements in business language:
  "As a Persona, I need [capability], so that I can [Outcome]."
  [^uctm-story]
- **Workflows** sequence stories into end-to-end processes that
  deliver outcomes.[^uctm-workflow]

Accountability is tightly connected to [transparency](transparency.md)
and [fairness](fairness.md): if decisions cannot be explained, or if
responsibilities are unclear, trust breaks down.

See also the [theme page](../theme/accountability.md) for a broader
discussion of accountability and automated policy management in the
EKG context.
