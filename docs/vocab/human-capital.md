# Human Capital

Human Capital refers to the collective knowledge, skills, expertise, 
experience, and capabilities possessed by individuals and teams 
within an organization. It represents the intellectual and creative 
assets that people contribute to organizational value creation.

In the context of Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKG), Human Capital 
needs to be _known, valued, leveraged and optimized_. This means:

- **Known**: The skills, expertise, and knowledge of individuals and 
  teams should be discoverable and accessible through the EKG, 
  enabling organizations to understand what capabilities exist within 
  their workforce.
- **Valued**: Human Capital should be recognized as a critical 
  organizational asset, on par with data and technology assets, 
  contributing to strategic decision-making and resource allocation.
- **Leveraged**: Organizations should actively utilize Human Capital 
  by connecting people with relevant opportunities, projects, and 
  knowledge, enabling better collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- **Optimized**: Through understanding and leveraging Human Capital, 
  organizations can improve productivity, innovation, and competitive 
  advantage by ensuring the right people are engaged with the right 
  work at the right time.

Human Capital complements [Data Capital](data-capital.md) as a 
fundamental organizational asset that, when properly managed and 
connected through an EKG, enables organizations to make better 
decisions, foster innovation, and achieve their strategic objectives.
