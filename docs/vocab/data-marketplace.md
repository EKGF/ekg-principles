# Data Marketplace

A Data Marketplace is the set of capabilities that helps data
publishers and data consumers find each other and exchange Data
Products across an enterprise ecosystem.

It typically supports:

- **Discovery**: searchable metadata, classifications, and contracts.
- **Access**: entitlement, delivery mechanisms, and usage controls.
- **Quality and trust**: provenance, lineage, and fitness signals.

Many people use "data marketplace" for the whole ecosystem, but in
these principles we use [Data Economy](data-economy.md) for the
broader view (supply, demand, exchange, and incentives), and
"Data Marketplace" for the enabling mechanism.

In an EKG context, Data Products can be implemented as
[Self-describing Datasets (SDDs)](sdd.md) so their meaning and
policies travel with them, and demand is expressed through
[Use Cases](use-case.md).
