# Openness

Openness is the ability of an enterprise or ecosystem to connect,
access, and reuse data and knowledge across boundaries.

Openness overlaps with [transparency](transparency.md), but it is
distinct: openness is about access, interoperability, and
participation across boundaries.

See the [theme page](../theme/openness.md) for the full explanation,
and [principle 4: Open World](../principle/04-open-world.md).
