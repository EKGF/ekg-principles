# Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG)

much like "the web" is a virtual concept,
an **Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG)** is a virtual concept 
that stands for the combination of all information and knowledge of a given
enterprise -- at any level in the organization -- or ecosystem.

See also [Enterprise Knowledge Graph](https://method.ekgf.org/article/ekg/) for
a more elaborate explanation.
