## What we mean by openness

Openness is the ability of an enterprise (and its ecosystem) to
connect, access, and reuse data and knowledge across boundaries.
Boundaries can be organizational, domain, technical, contractual, or
jurisdictional.

Openness overlaps with transparency, but it is not the same:

- **Openness** is about access, interoperability, and participation.
- **Transparency** is about visibility, explainability, and audit.

In other words:

- You can be open but not transparent (data is shared, but its meaning,
  provenance, and decision logic are opaque).
- You can be transparent but not open (internally auditable, but locked
  behind closed interfaces or siloed access).

## Openness in an EKG

An Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) supports openness by making assets
readable, discoverable, and explorable, while still respecting policy
and entitlements.

Openness shows up in practice as:

- **Connect and access**: reduce friction between silos and enable
  access within entitlement and policy boundaries.
- **Enable silo synergies**: allow knowledge assets to be reused
  across teams, domains, and systems.
- **Readable and explorable**: publish information and knowledge in
  machine-usable forms with resolvable meaning.
- **Confront MVOT**: embrace multiple versions of the truth and make
  them navigable, rather than forcing a single narrative.
- **Challenge assumptions**: enable viewpoints, sources, and
  interpretations to be compared, validated, and improved.

Openness is therefore not “everything is open to everyone”.
It is the ability to connect and reuse responsibly, at scale,
across an ecosystem.
