Meaning The meaning of every data point must be directly resolvable to a machine-readable mathematical definition. Distributed An EKG can incorporate any number of datasets of any number of data sources that can be hosted by any number of independent EKG Platforms. Any given access point provides connectivity to the EKG regardless of where it resides. Open World Information can vary over time, come from many internal and external sources, and be based on different identities and models.  These \"multiple versions of the truth\" need to be reconciled on access by context. Self-describing An EKG is composed of a set of self-describing datasets that provide information about lineage, provenance, pedigree, maturity, quality, and governance. The EKG Platform has policy enforcement services that are driven by these self-describing datasets. Measurement The quality and characteristics of the managed knowledge must be measurable and measured.  Measurement criteria are used to designate fitness-for-defined-purpose and must be actionable. Business Orientation All artifacts around and information in the EKG are linked to defined and prioritized use cases.  Nothing in the EKG exists without a known business justification and purpose. Control Entitlement, privacy, and business policies will be modeled in the EKG and automatically executed, enforced, and audited at the data point level. Ecosystem An enterprise will use a heterogeneous set of technologies and data sources that will be incorporated into the EKG over time.   All components of the ecosystem are subject to service level agreements. Standards Both the EKG Platform and knowledge content should be based on open standards.

These tools may be integrated into the software development process, and can be used  to automatically generate traceability links between artifacts, or to update  traceability information as artifacts are modified.

For example, a solid object can be transformed into a liquid or gas through a process  of heating or cooling.

For example, a society may undergo a transformation from a traditional to a modern  culture through changes in its social norms, values, and beliefs.</p> <p>In technology and business, transformations are often driven by changes in technology, market conditions, or customer needs.  For example, a business may undergo a transformation from a traditional brick-and-mortar  retail store to an online business through the adoption of new technologies,  such as e-commerce platforms and social media.
